# Portfolio Contact Form

This project provides a simple contact form that you can integrate into your portfolio website. It utilizes client-side JavaScript to send messages directly from your website to your email.

## Features

- Easy-to-integrate contact form for your portfolio website
- Client-side form validation for improved user experience
- Sends email messages directly from the user's browser without the need for a backend server

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

- A portfolio website where you want to integrate the contact form
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Installation and Usage

1. Copy the HTML code for the contact form (`index.html`) and paste it into the desired section of your portfolio website.
2. Customize the form fields and styling to match the design of your website.
3. Save the JavaScript code (`script.js`) and include it in your website's JavaScript files or directly within your HTML file.
4. Ensure that the form submission endpoint is correctly configured in the JavaScript code. If you want to handle form submissions on the server-side, set up a backend to process the form data and send emails.
5. Test the contact form on your website to ensure it works correctly.
6. Optionally, implement server-side validation and email handling to enhance security and reliability.

## Example Backend Setup (Optional)

If you prefer to handle form submissions on the server-side, follow these steps:

1. Set up a backend server using Node.js and Express.js.
2. Create a route to handle POST requests from your contact form.
3. Implement form validation and sanitization on the server-side to ensure data integrity.
4. Use a library like nodemailer to send emails with the form data.
5. Update the JavaScript code in `script.js` to submit form data to your backend endpoint instead of directly sending emails.
6. Test your contact form to ensure it works as expected with the backend integration.
